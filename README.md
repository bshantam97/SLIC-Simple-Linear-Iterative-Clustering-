### Course: CMSC 828I: Advanced Visual Learning and Recognition

### Description of the Project
In this project the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering algorithm has been implemented from sratch. 
In addition Kmeans ,  KMeans on 5D RGBXY space and KMeans with weighted distances has been implemented from scratch to compare the pixelwise and superpixel outputs of SLIC and Classical Unsupervised Clustering approaches.

### Outputs
The outputs can be views in the IPython notebook that has been provided. 
Tested the 3 algorithms for various values of k (Number of clusters).

### Libraries Used
1. OpenCV ( Primary for Loading Image data)
2. Numpy
