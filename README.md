In this project the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering alogorithm has been implemented from sratch. 
In addition Kmeans ,  KMeans on 5D RGBXY space and KMeans with weighted distances has been implemented from scratch to compare the pixelwise and superpixel outputs of SLIC and Classical Unsupervised Clustering approaches.
